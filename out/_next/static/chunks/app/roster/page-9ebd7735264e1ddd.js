With the agility and stamina of a baby deer, this lanky fcg will jog everywhere on his wobbly stilt legs. He likes to jog under or hover in open space ready to receive a disc on the sideline for few, if any, yards. He will then take his time on every fake and throw to ensure he looks casual doing it. Whether this means throwing a dish with a totally cocked wrist and almost missing his receiver because he wanted to flip the disc with the nonchalance of a unionized Frenchman or tossing a blade-scoober to the far handler in zone with the confidence of an affluent heterosexual white male in America. While he has some skill, he will overestimate his own abilities throwing downfield, or he will mindlessly dump for a loss like someone for whom yards have never been in short supply. When Zach goes deep it is often halfhearted though well timed. He will go deep from a standstill if there is nobody above him as well as after an easily guarded under cut.
