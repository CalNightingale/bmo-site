Instead, we swept our regular season tournaments: Florida Warmup, Smoky Mountain Invite, and Easterns. We then walked through sectionals and regionals, taking care of business against the region’s best. It wasn’t always pretty (needing to break somewhere between 2 and a million times in a row to beat NC State on double game point), but we usually got lucky and found a way to win – every game in fact, except our first of the season, against Minnesota. Arriving at Nationals, we knew we had put in the work to be able to beat any team in the field. After an up and down opening win against Cal Poly, things started clicking.
